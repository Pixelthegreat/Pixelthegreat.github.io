<h1>About</h1>
Some may call me Samuel Piero, others may call me Pebes Weatherman Stacener. However, do not get this confused, as neither of those are my real name. My actual real name is none of your business.<br><br>
I make fun and completely impractical web projects like <a href="tv/index.html">this</a>, and I run a <a href="blog/blog.html">blog</a>.<br><br>
This website is generally anything and everything I'd want to have in a personal site. From <a href="music.html">The Hall of Wall</a> to <a href="welbur.html">Welbur</a>, I invision this site as having all sorts of interesting stuff dug from the corners of my mind.<br><br>
I also enjoy writing, as you'll see from October 25th to October 31st on <a href="blog/blog.html">the blog</a>.
