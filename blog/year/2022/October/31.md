Welcome to this special installment of Porridge. This evening, sit back, relax, and read about this Holloween and Hanukkah related creature.

Hanukkah Man is quite an odd creature. Unlike most creatures that can stand upright, this one has two sets of joints in each limb instead of one. His teeth are sharp, and his mouth will usually hang open, presumably as a threat to anyone who dare cross his path.

His head contains a Menorah, with all nine candles lit. Like a Candle Wick, the candles never seen to burn out, and may be permanently attached to the rest of the body in some way or another.

There are plenty of old stories dating back to the 13th century of Hanukkah Man breaking into people's homes on the last night of Hannukah, and drinking all of their liquid beverages, before running out through the back window. These stories were interpreted as rumors and myths until the invention of photography, and today, six photos of Hannukah Man have been taken and have managed to survive until.

Hanukkah Man has also been seen breaking into people's multistory homes on Holloween. The path that he tends to take is up the stairs and through any back window, if there is one. Often times, he will just run off into the distance after that, but sometimes, he will climb onto the roof of the house and jump nearly 200 feet into the sky and off into the fog.

As a final note, not much is known about Hanukkah Man. Being that he is the only one known to exist and that he only emerges from the North Woods two times in a year, nobody has really been able to gather any information about him, beyond what we've already found.
