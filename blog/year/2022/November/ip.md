Wendy Ip is not a household name, and unfortunately so. I've been listening to her music since around early 2021, and I've really enjoyed her power pop and alternative rock style. As of November 7th, 2022, she has only 24 monthly listeners on Spotify, a pretty low number for a talented and passionate musician.

## Music

With 3 full-length albums under her belt, Wendy has been working in the music scene for more than 20 years now. Those 3 albums were released between 2001 and 2008, however, and there is (almost, i'll get to that) no word that anything new is coming along, although Wendy has written plenty of other songs during the time afterwards.

Her debut album is my personal favorite of hers, and one of my top albums of all time. In fact, if you couldn't already tell, this website was named after the album. Fan Favorites So Far was recorded during and/or before 2001, and released in 2001 to an unknown level of success. The album was recorded in a total of five different studios in California, New York, British Columbia and Manitoba. As a note for later, this album included the songs Just Wendy and All The Pain, both of which would be re-recorded for future albums of hers.

The album starts out with the song At The Seams, a pop and rock directed track, and one of three on the album to feature contributions from Pixie's guitarist Joey Santiago.
