I'm sorry to say that there will be no installment of Porridge today. I've been quite busy preparing for a family trip, and I haven't really had the time to write anything except in the morning. Although I would've liked to have written something for you before hand, I'm not that kind of person, and today just happens to be packing day. However, I won't wait until next Monday. Instead, I plan on finishing what I have in a couple of days, when I'm a bit settled in, and hopefully you can get something on Wednesday.

Until then, take care.
